<b>Dexter Development Environment version 4</b>.<br/>
DDE has several deployment platforms. <br/>
This "cloud" variant is the easiest for most people to access.
<p/>
DDE is an application that:
<ul>
  <li>is an extensive IDE for developing applications on the Dexter robot.<br/>
     Dexter is a 7 axis robotic arm.<br/>
     It is a product of Haddington Dynamics.</li>
  <li>makes it easy to learn and run JavaScript.</li>
  <li>makes it easy to learn robotics, especially for performing "stay in place" applications.</li>
  <li>facilitates learning AI, including ChatGPT.<br/>
      DDE's embedded GPT Interface helps you understand GPT's capabilities and<br/>
      make use of it for general purpose learning as well as helps you<br/>
      author code that calls GPT for knowledge-intensive applications.</li>
</ul>
We recommend modern versions of the Chrome browser.<br/>

The Cloud-based DDE first appeared in late June 2023 so consider it alpha software.<br/>
Its file I/O is poor.
